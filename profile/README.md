They will be challenged by the Olympic top duo Benjamin Thomas/Fabio Van den Bossche and European Champions Roger Kluge/Theo Reinhardt. Lotte Kopecky will also compete over two days in the Kuipke next week.

Never before has the same duo won the Lotto Zesdaagse Vlaanderen-Ghent three times in a row, but World Omnium Champion Lindsay De Vylder and Robbe Ghys could change that next week. Ghys, who prior to his double success with De Vylder also won twice with Kenny De Ketele, could become the first rider to win the Lotto Zesdaagse Vlaanderen-Gent five times in a row. Currently, the 27-year-old man from Limburg shares the longest winning streak with Patrick Sercu, who was dominated in the Kuipke four times in a row between 1970 and 1973, each time with a different teammate.

Who are the challengers for De Vylder/Ghys? Firstly, there’s Fabio Van den Bossche and Frenchman Benjamin Thomas, the bronze and gold medalists in the Paris Olympics Omnium. The 24-year-old from Laarne has already finished third and second in the Kuipke and is eager to climb another rung. 29-year-old Thomas who’s joining Van den Bossche is one of the most versatile and successful track cyclists of recent years. It is not a Ghent debut for Thomas, as he already finished second in the Ghent Six Days in 2017 alongside his compatriot Morgan Kneisky.

Besides Lindsay De Vylder (Omnium), two more World Champions from the past World Championships in Ballerup, Denmark, are coming to Ghent, namely German Roger Kluge (Madison) and Spaniard Sebastian Mora Vedri (Points race). Kluge forms a duo with his compatriot Theo Reinhardt, with whom he became European Madison Champion in Apeldoorn earlier this year. Next week, Mora will pilot our young compatriot Milan Van Den Haute, who two years ago won the U23 AVS Cup, the Six Days of the Future, which is also on this year’s programme each day.

This year, Ghent local and crowd favourite Jules Hesters forms a team with strong New Zealander Aaron Gate, the 2023 Points race World Champion. There are 9 Belgians in total, including the promising duo Noah Vandenbranden/Gianluca Pollefliet and debutant duo Matijs Van Strijthem/Nolan Huysmans.

Not only Belgium (9 riders), but the Netherlands (5) and France (4) are also strongly represented. This includes Yoeri Havik, who finished second in the Lotto Zesdaagse Vlaanderen-Gent the past two years. This year the Dutchman forms a team with his compatriot Vincent Hoppezak.
